# C Language Learning Project

This project is designed as a practical and concise introduction to the C programming language. Its primary objectives are to help me learn the core concepts, syntax, and characteristics of C through hands-on examples and exercises.

## Objectives

- Understand the fundamental syntax and structure of C programs.
- Explore key language features such as data types, control flow, functions, pointers, and memory management.
- Develop problem-solving skills by implementing small, focused programs.
- Gain familiarity with compiling and debugging C code using common tools.
- Highlight the characteristics that distinguish C, including its efficiency, low-level capabilities, and portability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (GCC recommended)
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts (recommended)
- If is possible use a GNU/Linux distribution ([EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) recommended)

### Building and Running

Compile C and execute files using a command like:

```shell
gcc src/filename.c -o build/output_executable
build/output_executable
```

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains source code examples and exercises.
- `include/` - Header files (if applicable).
- `build/` - Contains the binaries of compiled source code
- `docs/` - Additional learning materials and references.
